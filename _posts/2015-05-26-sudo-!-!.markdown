I don't remember when I found this out, but when I did, it changed my life.  
Ever get one of these?


{% highlight bash %}
wrobson$ mkdir /var/test
mkdir: /var/test: Permission denied
{% endhighlight %}

Permission denied? I'm pretty sure I have permission.
Now follow that up with one of these.  

{% highlight bash %}
wrobson$ sudo !!
sudo mkdir /var/test
Password:
{% endhighlight %}

The !!(bang bang) is repeating the last command entered.  
Now we have the sudo in the front and its asking for our password and completing without error.
